# Systematic Shoppers
### Problem Statement: 
Typically, shoppers are unaware of local grocery prices in their area. This is due to the large number of purchasable items, the variety of prices between stores, the fluctuating prices within stores, and the shopper’s ability to keep track of store prices.
### Background or Related Work: 
There are only two apps that are related to our work, Flipp and Instacart. Flipp searches only through a store’s digital flyers for coupons (Flipp, 2022). It does not calculate which store has the cheapest groceries, and the prices are not totaled for the user. Instacart allows users to shop at stores but not compare prices. Instacart does not use in-store prices, rather, prices are set by retailers on the Instacart app (Instacart Help Center - Item Pricing, n.d.), thus allowing retailers to introduce a markup.
### Solution Statement:
Based upon the items in the user’s shopping list (which they can store on the app), the app’s algorithms can find the best store in their area to save the most money in total. It can also filter stores by distance using location services. 
### Contribution:
Our app uses android location services to find stores near the user. We programmed with Kotlin (a java-based language) and XML using Android Studio. On the backend we used Firebase to store our data.
